# Week 1:
Here is a suggested task list for Siyona for the Ringworld project, based on the meeting notes:

Provide your GitHub username to the project lead so you can be added to the lgst Ringworld repository.

Accept the GitHub invitation and ensure you have access to the repository.

Set up your local development environment (install Python, required packages, and any recommended tools).

Download the Ringworld project code from GitHub.

Review the project README and available documentation.

Run the code locally to ensure it works on your system.

Familiarize yourself with the code structure, especially the main simulation files and solver modules.

Reach out to team members (e.g., Usman and James) if you have questions about the code or need help troubleshooting.

Prepare to contribute to project documentation or code as needed (e.g., updating README, clarifying comments).

Begin thinking about your goals and interests for the semester to help define your specific role or subproject within the team.

Let me know if you want this task list sent to your email or if you’d like to add or modify any items!



Week 2:

Here is a suggested task list for Siyona for the Ringworld project, based on the meeting notes:

Collaborate with Usman on the Statistical Modeling sub-team:

   - Assist in developing statistical correlations for modifications in Ringworld parameters (e.g., gravity, radius, temperature, surface pressure, central star mass).
   - Work on lowering uncertainties in model outputs, possibly using advanced statistical methods.
   - Help develop a catalog of proposed habitat designs versus their lifespans.
   - Explore how different traits (e.g., environmental parameters) combine to affect outcomes (e.g., linearly, multiplicatively).

Draft and contribute to the Semester Expectations Document (SED) for the statistical modeling sub-team:

   - Clearly outline your individual responsibilities and goals for the semester.
   - Coordinate with Usman to ensure the SED covers all required elements (tasks, success criteria, timeline).

Contribute to code and documentation:

   - Add comments and docstrings to any code you work on.
   - Help improve the clarity and usability of statistical modeling scripts.

Communication and coordination:

   - Participate in regular check-ins (meetings or email) with Usman and the project lead to update on progress and clarify tasks.
   - Copy the project lead on relevant communications, as requested.

(Optional, if time allows) Begin familiarizing yourself with R and R Studio, as these are used for statistical modeling in the project.

Let me know if you’d like this list refined or if you want it formatted for a specific purpose (e.g., email, SED draft, or project management tool).

Week 3:
Here is a task list for Siyona for the Ringworld project, based on the meeting notes:

Access the Ringworld simulation code repository and ensure you have the necessary permissions.

Review the README file and execution instructions in the repository to understand how the code works.

Set up your Python environment (using Anaconda or another method) and install any required modules.

Run the Ringworld simulation code on your local machine.

Interpret the results generated by the simulation and document your findings.

If you encounter any issues or have questions about the code or results, reach out to James, Barrett, Usman, or other team members for clarification.

Review the three main project areas: solar wind effects, gravity, and statistical modeling.

Contact the relevant project leads (Barrett for solar wind, James for gravity, Usman for statistical modeling) if you have questions about any of the areas.

Decide which of the three project areas you would prefer to work on and communicate your choice to the team by next week.

Stay engaged with the team and be prepared to take on additional tasks as you become more familiar with the project.

Let me know if you’d like this in a different format or if you want to assign due dates or priorities!

Week 4:

Here is a task list for Siyona for the Ringworld project, based on the latest meeting notes:

Coordinate with Usman on the statistical modeling project. Make sure to copy each other on all related emails.

Run the code from the GitHub repository for the project. Review and understand the code thoroughly.

After running a couple of sample simulations, be prepared to take on tasks to help parallelize the simulation workload.

Contribute to the shared OneDrive folder for Ringworld experimental data. Ensure your results and data are uploaded and organized.

Prepare and submit a brief weekly report before each meeting. The report should include:

   - What the SED says needs to be done
   - Your current progress
   - Any preliminary results or, if not available, your methods

Clearly document your individual contributions to the project, especially if working as part of a sub-team.

Communicate regularly with the sub team lead (Usman) and the rest of the team regarding your progress and any issues.

Let me know if you’d like this list formatted differently or if you want to add/remove any tasks!
